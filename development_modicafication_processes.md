# Development & Modification Processes Log
**Date**: 2026-02-19
**Focus**: Reading Section - Simulation Test UI Implementation

This document details the step-by-step development and refinement process for the "Simulation Test" section within the Reading page (`src/app/reading/page.tsx`).

---

## 1. Initial Setup & Layout
- **Objective**: Create a dedicated "Simulation Test" section replacing the placeholder content.
- **Action**: 
  - Implemented a 3-column grid layout for desktop.
  - Created three base cards representing **Part 5**, **Part 6**, and **Part 7**.
  - Applied consistent styling: White background, rounded corners (`rounded-[32px]`), and shadow effects.

## 2. content Structure & Card Design
- **Header**:
  - Added Number Badges (01, 02, 03) in a dark blue circle.
  - Added Titles (Part 5, 6, 7) and Subtitles (e.g., Incomplete Sentences).
- **Content Area**:
  - Implemented a bottom list section detailing sub-topics (e.g., Grammar Logic, Vocab Master) and estimated time (min).
- **Layout Refinement**:
  - **Height Adjustment**: Enforced a minimum height of `600px` (`min-h-[600px]`).
  - **Flexbox Alignment**: Used `flex flex-col` and `mt-auto` on the bottom list to ensure it always sits at the bottom of the card, creating a balanced vertical layout.

## 3. Visual Background Refinement (Iterative Process)
A major part of the session was dedicated to creating unique, visually appealing geometric backgrounds for each card.

### **Part 5 Card (Grid Pattern)**
1.  **Initial Idea**: Subtle, blurry circles.
2.  **Modification 1**: Changed to a **3x3 Grid** of circles.
3.  **Modification 2**: Adjusted positioning so the left and right columns are clipped by the card boundary (appearing as half-circles).
4.  **Modification 3**: Removed the blur effect for a sharper look.
5.  **Modification 4**: Adjusted circle size (`w-36 h-36`) and vertical spacing (`py-10`) to create distinct separation between rows.
6.  **Final Polish**: Applied a **Diagonal Gradient** (`bg-gradient-to-tl from-blue-50 to-blue-200`) creating a bright, dimensional look lightening towards the top-left.

### **Part 7 Card (Ring Pattern)**
1.  **Initial Idea**: Spinner animation.
2.  **Modification 1**: Created a ring of **8 large circles** (`w-32 h-32`).
3.  **Modification 2**: Applied a rotation animation (`animate-[spin_60s_linear_infinite]`).
4.  **Refinement**: Increased the radius of the ring (from 110px to **150px**) so the circles are spaced further apart and only slightly overlap.
5.  **Styling**: enhancing consistency with Part 5 using the same blue gradient.

### **Part 6 Card (Corner Blobs)**
1.  **Initial Idea**: Two large circles at opposite corners.
2.  **Modification 1**: Positioned one at **Top-Right** and one at **Bottom-Left**.
3.  **Modification 2**: Significantly increased size to **450px** (`w-[450px]`) so they gently overlap in the center.
4.  **Gradient Tuning**: 
    - **Top-Right Circle**: Gradient darkens towards the center (`bg-gradient-to-bl`).
    - **Bottom-Left Circle**: Gradient initially darkened outwards, then **inverted** (`from-blue-200 to-blue-50`) to become lighter towards the center, creating a cohesive depth effect.

## 4. "Step" Arrow Buttons
- **Objective**: Add call-to-action buttons for each step.
- **Design**:
    - Created a "Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3" button component.
    - Used **CSS Clip-path** (`polygon(...)`) to create a distinct arrow shape pointing right.
    - **Background**: Custom striped gradient (`linear-gradient(110deg, ...)`) using multiple shades of blue for a segmented, dynamic look.
    - **Interaction**: Added a "Start ->" badge with a hover scale effect.
- **Placement Logic**:
    - **Initial Attempt**: Placed inside the card's bottom section.
    - **Correction**: Moved **OUTSIDE** and **BELOW** the card to act as a footer.
    - **Implementation**: Wrapped each Card + Button pair in a `flex flex-col gap-6` container to ensure proper alignment and spacing.

## 5. Animation Details
- **Animated Divider**:
    - Replaced the static header divider with a dynamic animation.
    - **Mechanism**: A light gray track (`bg-slate-100`) with a dark blue pill (`bg-[#1e3a8a]`) sliding from left to right.
    - **Code**: Added `@keyframes slideBar` and `.animate-slide-bar` CSS to handle the infinite sliding motion.

## Summary of Files Changed
- `src/app/reading/page.tsx`: 
    - Added new structure for Simulation Test section.
    - Added styled JSX for keyframes.
    - Implemented new card components and layout logic.
